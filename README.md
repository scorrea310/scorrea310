### Hi there I'm Steve ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Fullstack Engineer that pivoted from solving business problems in tech sales (Machine Learning/Ai space)
to solving business problems with code. @UC Berkeley '19"

I have spent the last 7 months digging deep into code and building fun projects with great people. I encourage you to take a peek at my work below!
